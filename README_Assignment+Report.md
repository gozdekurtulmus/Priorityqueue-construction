**PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 1**

**Due date:** 29.10.2021 23:00

In this assignment, you are required to implement [priority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)[queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)construction in C and compare the

performance of your implementation with Java-based implementation.

In your C implementation, you are required to use [max](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-using-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-using-binary-heap/)[binary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-using-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-using-binary-heap/)[heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-using-binary-heap/), where the value of parent node

will always be greater than the value of child node, and the value at the root must be maximum

among all the values. Specifically, you need to use [array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[representation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[of](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[binary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)[ ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-representation-of-binary-heap/)in your

implementation with the following properties:

The root element will be at Arr[0]

Arr[(i-1)/2] Returns the parent node

Arr[(2\*i)+1] Returns the left child node

Arr[(2\*i)+2] Returns the right child node

You only need to implement the *queue* function, which inserts a new element into the queue (no

need for dequeue etc. operations).

You are free to choose the way in your Java code, but it is recommended to use [PriorityQueue](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html)[ ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html)[class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html).

You can assume that your queue can include up to 2^28 elements. To be able to store that big array,

you may need to create your array by [malloc](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[instead](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[of](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[an](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[type](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)[ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575544/difference-between-array-type-and-array-allocated-with-malloc)(If you have

limitations due to your computer settings, you can reduce the array size).

Additionally, in your C code, you will implement a *convert* function, which converts the array

representation into a data structure represented by pointers and links between the elements. Each

element is to be represented by the following structure:

struct node

{

int data;

struct node\* left;

struct node\* right;

};

Your program flow should be as follows:

**1)** Read a set of unordered integer values (separated by space) from a text file into an array.

**Example:** A= [45 20 14 12 31 7 11 13]

**2)** Build the priority queue in an array by processing the integer values one by one. Add each

integer by considering that the value is representing the priority. Note that at the end of each

insertion, you should have a priority queue. That is you should not have all values in some structure

(like a binary tree) first, then convert into priority queue.

**Example:**

B= [45]

B= [45 20]

B= [45 20 14]





B= [45 20 14 12]

B= [45 31 14 12 20]

…

B= [45 31 14 13 20 7 11 12]

**3)** Convert your array representation into a data structure with pointers.

**Example:**

Node1:

Node2:

Node3:

Node4:

…..

data = 45, left = Node2, right = Node3

data = 31, left = Node4, right = ...

data = 14 ...

data = 13 ...

**4)** Traverse the structure, save your array in a text file.

**Example file content:**

45 31 14 13 20 7 11 12

Your program should measure and report the execution time for building the array structure. The

measured time should not include the I/O operations. Time measurement should be done in the

following order:

read the input file into an array

start time

build queue (array representation)

stop time

// file read operation

// the operation we want to measure

convert your queue array into structure with pointers

print resulting structure by breadth first traversal to the output file

// file write operation

You are required to write a report and include both functionality and performance results: 1) A

simple example including ~20 integers showing that your program is building the queue correctly.

\2) A test case with ~2^28 integers and timing information for that case.
